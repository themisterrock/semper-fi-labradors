        <details open>
          <summary><strong>When can the puppies leave?</strong></summary>
          <p class="small">Puppies are ready to leave for their new homes from 8 weeks of age. The exact date depends on their whelping date and veterinary schedule.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Whatâ€™s included when I adopt a puppy?</strong></summary>
          <p class="small">Each puppy goes home with a full starter package including microchip registration, first vaccination, flea and worming record, a bag of their current food, a care guide, and a comfort blanket that smells like mum.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Do you offer visits before adoption?</strong></summary>
          <p class="small">Yes! We welcome both virtual and in-person visits after reviewing your application. This helps ensure a good match for both you and the puppy.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Can you ship puppies to other states?</strong></summary>
          <p class="small">We prefer in-person collection, but we can discuss transportation options on a case-by-case basis to ensure your puppyâ€™s safety and comfort.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Are the puppies socialised before going home?</strong></summary>
          <p class="small">Absolutely. Our puppies are raised in a family environment with children, household noises, and early experiences like crate and car training. This helps them adjust smoothly to their new homes.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Do you provide support after adoption?</strong></summary>
